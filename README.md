# Getting Started with this project:

You need to add your own REACT_APP_API_KEY from the maps javascript API in a .env file to be able to use this app in development.

## More about the App:

- This project was created using react, typescript, and pure CSS.

## Improvements suggested :

- It will be good to show the user the name and an image of the city they clicked on, this way it will be educational and fun.
- Limiting the amount of time the user has to answer will also give it more of an edge.
- Be able to find every city in the world instead of nine only in the EU 
- Store the data in a session so the user can save their progress if they leave the site and then return.
- Have user sessions so the user can compare their score with other users' scores.

## Challenges:

- the most challenging aspect of this project was to choose the proper library to work with the google maps API in react. 
  The documentation was very limited in most of them and spent more hours doing research than actually coding.

## Highlights:

- I learned a lot about how much you can personalize and manipulate the map and markers to suit your needs. 
- After understanding the flow I realized that the maps API actually provides the developer with a great amount of data in a very simple way.
